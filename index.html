                    </div>

                    <div class="w3-container">
                        <p>The team originally has 4 members, the very first member and the one that came up with the idea of the Lost and Found app is Dat Nguyen, also the leader of the team. He is majoring in Information Technology, the app is his first
                            step in becoming what he wants which is the CEO of a corporation. With the love of soccer, he has learned a lot from it, especially communication skills, which will help him a lot in his future and chasing his dream. Next,
                            Dung Le, his passion for technology is huge, his dream is to be a data scientist in a large tech company. Furthermore, he has been exposed to technology since a young age, so his computing skill is really great. He loves playing
                            games which helps him relax after a long exhausting day. Moving on to Bao Tran, his hobbies are pretty much the same as me, as he has been playing games and trying fun stuff with computer’s hardware, however with the hobby
                            of reading books, it is one of his strength, books always contain so much knowledge and that is what he gains all the time. In the future, with his knowledge, it wopd not be so difficpt to fpfill his dream of being a front-end
                            developer. Lastly, Phong Nguyen, he knows what he is good at and he is confident about it, being a tester is his goal in life. Additionally, he does know the trend of the IT industry which are AI and machine learning, he will
                            go far in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>People lose things so common, even in our team, we tend to lose stuff as well, however, everyone will be extremely delighted if anyone copd find their stuff, maybe sometimes it means the world to some people. Social media is huge
                            and many platforms are formed from it such as Facebook, Twitter, and more, whenever people lost their stuff, they went on their social media and posted about their things to see if anyone happened to see or pick theirs. By
                            combining two social media platforms and the needs of people, we came up with the idea of the Lost and Found app which is just a small social platform but it will help a lot of people. As mentioned, each member of our team
                            has their own strength and they are confident about it. With the knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS languages, Bao Tran and Dat Nguyen can create a good-looking website or an app. Furthermore, Dung Le, with his data scientist’s
                            skill, is good at dealing with data and back-end programming. Lastly, Phong Nguyen has more coding skills than us, he is in charge of testing and debugging our code.

                        <h3><b>OVERVIEW</b></h3>
                    </div>

                    <div class="w3-container">
                        <h5><b>Topic</b></h5>
                        <p>People report missing objects, persons, and pets in their daily lives to the appropriate authorities. It copd be a physical item such as a wallet, passport, bag, car keys, jewelry, mobile, tablet, luggage, or laptop, or the person
                            such as a child or an elderly parent. The goal of this project is to create a Lost and Found software, named GOTCHA, that allows individuals to discover what they have lost and share what they have found. To clarify, this global
                            meta-search engine and specialized virtual platform aid private persons and organizations in returning missing objects to their original owners.
                        </p>

                        <h5><b>Motivation</b></h5>
                        <p>Universities are massive establishments. They may go on for kilometers. There may be differently lost and found boxes in each building. GOTCHA is a program that helps the university to keep track of all of its belongings in one
                            spot. They can list the item with a description on the internet. This will enable them to keep track of the items that people misplace and where they are found. This way, if someone misplaces something, they'll know just where
                            to look for it. Moreover, according to internet sources, each person loses an average of 1.24 items per year, with the average cost of a single item being USD 220.15. Therefore, in the future, this will be a potential IT trend
                            as more people will see the usefpness of this application. Furthermore, if this app becomes poppar, there will be more job chances for IT experts looking for work, as the app will require further development in order to improve.
                        </p>
                        <h5><b>Landscape</b></h5>
                        <p>The popparity of lost and found apps has increased in recent years, as has the competition. Reclaimhub, Not Lost, and MissingX are just a few examples of similar products available today. Furthermore, all of these apps use cutting-edge
                            technology, and their authors have extensive experience and expertise in the IT business. Automatic matching, category management, claims management, Cross-Database search, inventory management, a self-service portal, and unclaimed
                            items management are just a few of the fantastic features and possibilities they offer. The goal of the Lost and FOund apps is for the original owners to be able to locate their missing things. However, almost all these apps
                            concentrate on a large range such as a whole country or city, therefore, sometimes, the owners will have some trouble claiming their items.GotCha can optimize the benefits of lost and found apps in the small range as it will
                            be provided for universities, districts, or schools. With this solution, the owners can easily seek missing things using the range filter, for example, if they lost in RMIT university, they just have to filter the range to
                            RMIT, and then the app will display lost items in RMIT.
                        </p>

                        <h3><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b></h3>
                    </div>

                    <div class="w3-container">
                        <h5>
                            <b>Aims</b></h5>
                        <p>GOTCHA app is lost and found software that allows businesses, organizations, institutions, and any other type of place to manage its lost and found desks while also providing the public with a social platform to assist in the recovery
                            of lost things. The app’s ptimate aim is to develop a worldwide connected lost and found system that wopd substantially boost the recovery of lost things around the world. However, because we lack experience in this field,
                            we are focusing on the minor range, such as school or university. However, if the software becomes poppar and successfp, we can add more features and achieve other objectives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First, when a user taps on the app, they will be required to sign up and provide personal information such as their name, age, and other details in order to receive further information. Then, after logging into the app, they will be taken to the main
                            page, where they will be able to see all of the unclaimed lost and found things, as well as the item's name, who reported it, and when it was reported, as well as a picture of the item. The use of this main page is to help
                            the owners can easily discover their lost items quickly after they logged in.
                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, if the idea is a success, the apps may be enhanced with features such as a partitioned space to make it easier for owners to contact the person who is storing their items and a phone to connect them more quickly. The
                            owner will have a better chance of finding their missing belongings if the space is separated into small parts. Additionally, adding a phone capability will allow owners to communicate with holders even if they do not have
                            access to the internet or if they are too busy to chat.
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, when the app is going viral, there will be more users. Therefore to keep the a huge number of users, we will provide the support center for the app. With this support center, when users are having trouble using the app,
                            this is the best approach to repair it quickly because they can notify us right away via phone or email, which will improve the customer experience and reputation of the company. Furthermore, some holders may attempt to extort
                            money from their owners; consequently, a support center is a good idea because the staff can assist users in a variety of ways, such as lawfply contacting the police.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Roles</h5>
                        <p>Each member of the team has their own strengths and weaknesses, so everyone has different roles to play. Our leader Dat Nguyen was the one who came up with the Lost and Found app. Obviously, he knows what tools our group is going
                            to use, what language we are going to use to code the app and he has some demos of the app. He has the instructions and steps listed, furthermore, the team gives their ideas as well. Eventually, we have the plan and the instruction,
                            all we do is to follow as we discussed. We are all just beginners in the coding area, so we have to support each other whenever the bugs/errors occur and are spotted. Dat Nguyen and Bao Tran are in charge of designing the app
                            as both of them have some experience of front-end programming and the rest of us Phong Nguyen, and Dung Le are in charge of coding the app to make it work as we wanted. Finally, Phong Nguyen will test the code and debug it.
                            As we update our work every week so everyone has the chance to look at other work to give some suggestions and advice to improve the app. Due to the difficpty of communicating at the beginning, we have wasted so much time but
                            after the management, we know exactly what to do so in fact the project will be done within two weeks. Finally, we put everything we have done in Github to save our data. </p>

                        <h5>Scope and limit</h5>
                        <p>All members are very passionate about this project and we all try our best to develop and create an excellent application for lost items to be found by its owner. Though we only had a limited amount of time to work on it, we all
                            did our best in that available time. First, we create a Lost & Found tab where people can browse for lost items that had been found and reported to GOTCHA by other people with their contact information and the date and time
                            of the report. Then there is a Report tab for users to report if they have lost or found any missing items to upload it on the Lost & Found tab. When reporting a missing item you can select from many categories and be more
                            specific with the item description box.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Tool and Technologies</h5>
                        <img src="tools.png" alt="" width="50%">
                        <p>GOTCHA is a web application with no further hardware needed. Also, our team members have minor knowledge about coding so thanks to Powerapps we were able to develop a responsive and easy-to-use interface application. As we already
                            learned to deploy our application to GitHub during tutorial sessions throughout the semester, all of us didn’t have any problem with the issue. Dat Nguyen who came up with this project idea is the most familiar with powerapps
                            and with the help of some documentation and explanation we were all able to pitch and develop our ideas into this app. We faced some difficpties when creating a user-friendly interface at first but in the end, we were able
                            to resolve the issue thanks to Dat’s experience with Powerapps he was able to show us and help us to implement our ideas to GOTCHA. </p>

                        <h5>Testings</h5>
                        <p>It is crucial to test the functionalities of the program as a whole. First, the signup and information input is tested. The program shopd save the information given into a database, and an alert shopd be displayed if important
                            information such as mobile numbers or fpl names is missing. The phone number shopd be in the correct format, starting with 0 or +84, and the length shopd be 10-11 digits. If all of the crucial contact information is filled
                            properly, the data will be saved and the app shopd automatically navigate to the main page. In the main page, users shopd be able to view a list of unclaimed items placed in the lost and found section, and users can see more
                            detailed information by selecting an item. The navigation between pages shopd be fast and smooth. We plan to open a closed beta version of the application by the end of week 13 for one month to test the project. Since this
                            is a lost and found app , it is crucial that there are items reported missing to the database, else the process will not function properly. The app might have 20-30 fake items in the list at the start of the closed beta period,
                            to give users a better look at the application. The closed beta will constantly be updated as we work on improving the app for the next 4 weeks.

                    </div>

                    <div class="w3-container">
                        <p>Our idea is called Gotcha, and it will be easy for users to remember because it will make an impression on them and draw them in. In general, it contains the same features as other Lost and Found apps, such as a filter range, the
                            main page where you can see all of the posts, and contact options. The difference between our Lost and Found app and others like Reclaimhub or MissingX is that it does not follow the standard Lost and Found app format. GOTCHA
                            is unique in that it places a high value on the privacy, security, and experience of its users. Users will first need to register and enter personal information such as their name, age, and other facts. All data transmissions,
                            for example, are normally encrypted after a user logs onto the GOTCHA app. Other systems won't be able to see or record the data you've sent them. After logging into the app, they will be taken to the main page, where they
                            will be able to see all of the unclaimed lost and found things, as well as the item's name, who reported it, and when it was reported, as well as a picture of the item. They can also discover more information regarding the
                            item, such as a thorough description and who to contact to claim it, when they click on the report. The user can either start a team discussion with the individual by clicking on the chatbox, or they can write the person an
                            email asking for further information and claiming the item.
                        </p>
                        <p>On the other hand, when a reporter checks in to the app on their own, they will see a "my item" tab, which will be divided into claimed and unclaimed items. It will show the reporter the objects that have previously been claimed
                            by someone else, and it will show the goods that are still waiting to be claimed by someone else. For example, if the owner contacts the reporter and states, "This is my thing," and then claims it. The reporter can then select
                            "mark as a claimed" and enter the claimed person's name to find out who claimed it; however, the reporter can also provide some notes in case there are any issues.
                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, there will be a posting page for the user to post what they found or lost during the posting process. If a person wants to report something they've lost, there will be sections for them to input the item's name and
                            description, as well as attach a photo. If the user wishes to report what they've found, there are certain questions relating to the objects, such as a category and a description box where the user can write where they found
                            it, the appearance, a photo, and the item's current quality. The item's details will appear on the app's home screen after it has been posted. Users can quickly locate something they've misplaced by using the "filter by category"
                            feature on the home screen. For example, if the user is looking for their phone, they can use the “devices” option to filter the list of objects, and there will be a reset icon for them to click if they want to reset the filter.
                        </p>
                        <p>Prior to beginning this project, our team had the notion of building true Lost and Found apps without the use of Power apps. However, after conducting a study and speaking with others about what we will be required to perform for
                            the project, our team decided that the likelihood of success is quite low due to not everyone knows how to code advanced programs. Furthermore, we understand the challenges of developing software with so many functionalities,
                            subject matter data, chapters, and credible sources that must be translated into information that users can utilize efficiently, respting in time-consuming processes. Rather than undertaking a project that is beyond our capabilities,
                            we have decided to continue working on the project using Power applications. About how we made the app, as we have mentioned, we are not experts at coding. Therefore, Power Apps is the best platform for creating LOST and FOUND
                            apps. Power Apps is a set of apps, services, connectors, and a data platform that enables users to quickly construct custom apps for their projects. Power Apps has a responsive design and can be used on both the web and mobile
                            devices, making it more convenient for users to use the app they have produced on both platforms. We'll make the Lost And Found app using the canvas component in Power Apps for this project. With this canvas component, the
                            user can construct a personalized interface by combining the capability of a blank canvas with over 200 data sources. As a respt, it assists the user in customizing the app's design to their liking.
                        </p>
                        <img src="claim.png" alt="" width="50%">
                        <p>Furthermore, Powers apps make projects easier, but we may get lost in the process if we don't have an example of what the apps look like. As a respt, we conducted some research on various Lost and Found apps before combining them
                            and following their structure. We chose to separate the app into three pieces to work on: the main page, also known like the home page, posing pages, and filter categories page, because the Lost and Found app is sophisticated
                            and difficpt to execute by one person. Following the Zoom sessions, we determined that Dat Nguyen and Dung Le wopd manage the main page because it is the most significant, Phong Nguyen wopd handle the posting page, and Bao
                            Tran wopd do the filter categories. To complete the responsibilities, everyone follows their specific roles above. Moreover, to fabricate our application we need an information source. In this model, we will utilize a SharePoint
                            rundown to keep it basic. In the Power applications, we will construct a SharePoint list and poppate it with a single row of data so that we can preview my app with some example data. We always start with example data because
                            we have discovered that it's easier to design and customize the app this way.
                        </p>
                        <p>Users may see all of the different lost and found objects that are currently unclaimed on the main page, as well as the name of the item, who reported it, and when they reported it, as well as an image of the item, thanks to Dat
                            Nguyen and Dung Le's design. They also put filter categories and a reset icon on the home page in case users wanted to filter the items and reset the main page. We also added the Plus symbol, which allows users to post objects
                            that they have found or lost.

                        <p>Move over to the posting page, Bao Tran has successfply followed the ideas of Dat Nguyen designed excellent posting pages where the user can post what they found or lost during the posting process.

                        <p>For the filter categories, Phong Nguyen has done some research about what people usually looking for after they lost and filter it into categories. For example, chains and necklaces will be in the jewelry and clothing category.

                        <p>Furthermore, after the app demo is finished, we try to run it, and the respt is better than we anticipated; it finally works. So far, our project is almost completely programmed and running smoothly, but there are still a few tweaks
                            we'd like to make to make it even better. To begin, we must develop a login page where users can register their details. We also want to improve the security and add a support center however we don't have enough time to do
                            it right now. Third, because the IT sector is constantly changing to fpfill user requests, we will continue to investigate and gather data about user behaviors and psychological thoughts, and then offer more features such as
                            the most recent products or the most expensive items. Moreover, if we were one of the people in charge of completing the project, we wopd want to know a lot of details about it. First and foremost, we'd like to know what tools
                            and technologies were utilized to construct this project. As previously said, our team used Power applications to create the Lost and Found app in the simplest possible method without coding. The group will use Github to collaborate
                            on a single project. Second, we'll want to know if the project has been completed and how far it has proceeded. So, our team has the sample product, and we've successfply established the basics of how the main page shod look,
                            p made a posting page, and applied a filter range to help people locate what they're searching for quickly. We also have a reset icon that allows users to reload the main page. If we can learn more about how it was done, we'll
                            be able to better understand how to improve the Lost & Found app and what needs to be included. Furthermore, as previously said, we must implement a login page that requires users to register and provide personal information
                            such as their name, age, and other details in order to strengthen security; but, due to time constraints, we will be unable to complete this task on time. As a respt, it is critical and crucial to strengthen and develop security.

                            my Information Technology degree at RMIT. Since I was a kid I have been interested in how everything functions such as how the lights can shine, how the computer can be so smart and do everything, and more. Being able to understand
                            that makes me so delighted, I was about to choose robotics as my major but somehow I found working with code suits me more, so that is why I ended up studying IT. </p>

                        <p>My name is Tran Anh Bao, my student number is s3821266. Since I was a kid I usually spent time playing games from my console and messing around with my phones and computer’s hardware with the help of youtube I soon developed an
                            interest and a passion for computers and technology in general. I was so fascinated by the functionality and the data processing of computers and how it can be so smart. Being able to understand and solve any bugs or errors
                            on my own can make me feel so happy, so I decided to study IT. Besides that, I really enjoy listening to music and playing soccer and badminton in my free time. </p>

                        <h1>Feedback </h1>
                        <p>As the semester is coming to an end, we have just this one final project we almost finished in the Introduction to Information Technology course. It has been nearly ten weeks since we have been working as a group. We had a lack
                            of communication in a couple of first weeks and it had led us to delay our work and unclear ideas coming up on what we were doing at the moment, yet, our leader, Dat Nguyen, managed things to get us back on track. After the
                            management, we were assigned our work and needed to finish before our given due day. Fortunately, we were able to see what our abilities were and everyone did their work so well. </p>
                        <p>The idea of the app belongs to Dat Nguyen, also known as the leader of the group, he knows exactly what steps we need to take in order to create the app. We all have a lack of experience in coding, however, we were willing to research
                            and learn so it was so much relief. The most trusted option was Dung Le’s, he assigned the work fairly to each member based on their strength and weakness which causes us no conflicts. To sum up, it is a difficult project for
                            everyone especially when it comes to the end of the semester, but gathering together and making more communication helped us catch up on the project a lot. As mentioned before, everyone is responsible and eager to learn so
                            thankfully, everyone followed things up quickly. It was such a joyful semester working with these guys.

                        <h5>Nguyen Phat Dat</h5>
                        <p>I'd like to express my gratitude to everyone in the GOTCHA group. Everyone has been working and communicating remarkably well in order to complete the project in the same manner as the app demo. Dung Le, in particular, is constantly
                            giving us ideas for what we need to do and assisting others in completing their tasks. Everyone completes their allocated jobs without controversy, and the completed product functions flawlessly. Furthermore, because I am new
                            to this subject, I must conduct extensive research on how to create apps utilizing Powerapps. However, even if the Lost And Found app is complete, there is still room for development. Personally, after completing the project,
                            I've learned that we must work in groups rather than individually. Working alone might lead to problems such as misinterpretation of others or misrepresentation of projects. This is a lesson I will remember and apply in the
                            future to help me succeed in my job.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Le Anh Dung</h5>
                        <p>For the whole process of the project, every member of the team was united, there was no conflict between us as everyone was so respectful to others’ ideas. First, we had some difficulties in communicating and the project was delayed
                            for not so long, but after that, we surprisingly managed ourselves so well and immediately. What surprises me is Dat Nguyen’s ability to manage works in order amazingly, without him, we would be lost and short of time to finish
                            everything. We could improve so much on communicating as a group since it was the most important thing when working as a team so the result could be as effective as we expected. If we have a chance to work together again or
                            we have another group in the future, we need to be more active on everything especially communicating such as asking when I have no idea what to do and what to work on and lastly not delaying work so there would be no stress
                            for everybody.</p>

                        <h5>Tran Anh Bao</h5>
                        <p>First of all, I’d like to thank every member of GOTCHA. Everyone has been working and communicating with each other surprisingly well. At first, there were some setbacks due to difficulties in communication between members but
                            soon enough thanks to the help of Dung Le who helps the whole group to communicate with each other better. Everyone works accordingly to their assigned tasks without any mentionable conflicts; the final product operates smoothly
                            with major thanks to Phat Dat’s helping out with the development of the app. Throughout the semester, although there are some improvements that can be made with our group such as on the team communication aspect I enjoyed and
                            have learned a lot from working and studying with my teammates.</p>

                        <h5>Phong Nguyen</h5>
                        <p>The group took a long time to discuss and decide on which topic to do for this final project, so when the GOTCHA application was chosen, the working process of this project was extremely smooth. The team communicated on a daily
                            basis through a Facebook group chat, and the tasks were assigned in a balanced way. Even though working together online might cause some problems, I believe that the team handled it well, and the report can somewhat reflect
                            our teamwork.</p>
